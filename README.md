# SFMLGameJam2016
A game made for the SFML Game Jam 2016
Theme was "Failure is an option"

You are an orange guy and your task is to jump. You can bounce of the walls only when you are jumping, and not when you are falling. If you fail there is still hope for you. Not much though.

I have used the AssetManager and Animator from the book SFML Essentials
